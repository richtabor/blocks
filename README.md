The Todo List block is a simple, editor-only block designed to quickly add tasks directly within the editor. Todo List makes it easy to keep track of publishing tasks, all in the context of a particular post. You may also use it to add a publishing checklist to the post, such as using a headline analyzer, adding featured images, adding social images, etc.

The [Markdown Comment](https://richtabor.com/markdown-comments/) block allows you the ability to add, and keep, any relevant editing comments within posts, without rendering them on the front-end. That means you are freed up to mentally jot any idea down without thinking about it.
